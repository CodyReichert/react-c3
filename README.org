React-C3 is a React.js component for building C3.js graphs. It's a
small file and has a simple interface.

Currently, only a small subset of the C3.js API is supported, but it's
enough to build several types of graphs by simply passing a couple of
props and utilizing the React Component lifecycle methods to render
and update c3.

React-C3 uses some ES6 features, so be sure to precompile with Babel.

* Usage

  The component takes three required props:
  + =data= A list of data points for the c3 graph. Ex:
    #+BEGIN_SRC js
      columns: [
          ['data1', 75],
          ['data2', 42]
      ]
    #+END_SRC
  + =element= An HTML Id for the rendered graph. Ex: =#mygraph=
  + =type= The type of graph to generate. Ex: =donut=, =pie=, =guage=


* Example

  #+BEGIN_SRC js
    import React from 'react';
    import Chart from 'react-c3';

    let App = React.createClass({

        _chartData: function() {
            let chartData =  [
                    ['data1', 75],
                    ['data2', 42]
            ];
            return chartData;
        },

        render: function() {
            return (
                <div>
                    <Chart data={this._chartData} />
                </div>
            );
        }

    });
  #+END_SRC
